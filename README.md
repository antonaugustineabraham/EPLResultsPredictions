Study the methodology for predicting football match outcomes (H,D,A wins)

"DataExtract.py" extracts EPL results and bookmaker odds data from the internet and saves it as "MatchDataEnglish.csv".

"BettingEPL.py" uses this data to predict match outcomes for the 21/22 EPL season by estimating results using a Poisson based method and compares the results against the actuals and bookmaker odds.
